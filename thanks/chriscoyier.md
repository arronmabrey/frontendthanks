A butterfly flaps its wings in St. Petersburg, fours years later a guy gets to quit his day job to pursue his own passions. Sometimes it's hard to pinpoint what events in your life lead you to where you are now, but in my case, one of them is very easy: Front End Design Conference.

Dan invited me to the very first one (remember when Dan was @webdesignfanboy on Twitter?!). Shaking in my boots, I accepted. I had never spoken at a conference before. I went, I did it. I refuse to watch the recording - I'm sure it was god-awful - but it doesn't matter. It gave me confidence, it gave me motivation, and it opened up doors for me.

Thank you, Dan, Cherrie, and the whole Front End Design Conference gang for changing my life, and countless others, for the better.
