# Give Back t-shirt
Dan Denney has exemplified "giving back" by organizing Frontend Design Conf for the past six years. If you've had the opportunity to attend this event, you know it's truly been about the community. Since this is the last year for Frontend Design Conf, we want to offer this shirt as a reminder of what it is that makes this industry beautiful. All profit will go to Dan and Cherrie as a "Thank You" for their hard work. <a href="https://cottonbureau.com/products/to-dan-and-cherrie">Buy a shirt</a>. Give back.
