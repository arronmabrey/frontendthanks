I (not so) vividly remember trying to buy a round of drinks for Dan at one of the Front-End Conf after-parties. If you&rsquo;ve every tried to buy Dan a drink, you know how difficult it can be. He&rsquo;s the kind of guy that wants to *buy* the drink, not have one bought for him. Somehow, I managed to sneak one in&#8212;a PBR in a can&#8212;and was then carted to the karaoke stage along with Dan and a few other attendees where we promptly sang Bon Jovi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Livin&rsquo; on a Prayer.&rdquo; Just one of many great memories I have from Front-End Design Conference. Good times. 

I&rsquo;ve only known Dan for a couple years, but I knew after first speaking with him that he was a kindred spirit. He demonstrates the kinds of qualities I&rsquo;m really drawn to in this biz: humility, skill, and empathy for his team. Nowhere has this been more evident than in he and Cherrie&rsquo;s organizing of the Front-End Design Conference. They&rsquo;ve done a fantastic job of curating incredibly relevant content but also facilitating great interactions.

Dan, Cherrie, and their family have given a lot over the years. They&rsquo;ve provided an amzaing place to exchange ideas. They&rsquo;ve brought us together. I&rsquo;m grateful for it and truly believe our industry is better because of them. Thanks Dan and Cherrie. You guys rock.
