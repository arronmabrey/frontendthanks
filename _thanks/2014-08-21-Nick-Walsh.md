Not long after the fourth iteration of Front-End, I asked Dan what compelled him to start his own event. Sheepishly, he just smiled and said it was an amazing excuse to talk with industry folks in St. Pete - both talented attendees and devoted speakers. He worked to make the conference something he would love going to, and that was infectious.

It's always been easy discern what sort of person Dan is. Year after year, the event staff is made up of his family: Cherrie, his mom, his daughter, brothers-in-law, and countless others. They don't just go through the motions - they've become part of Front-End. When Jason (who'd go on to speak twice) and I first attended, they supplied gluten-free snacks and libations unprompted so that he could partake as well. Those sort of things stick with you.

As a company, we try to attend at least one local (Florida) conference and something outside the state each year. Even with the ability to pick events virtually anywhere, the little get-together in St. Pete was always the team's favorite.

Dan, it was a  pleasure to attend and later take part in Front-End. I'm sad to see it go, but having you on the team is no small consolation. Thank you.
