Dan Denney, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways:

## Dan Is Generous
Seriously, Dan is one of the most genuine, kind, and generous people I've come to know. He always thinks of others first, and himself last.

## Dan Is Humble
He has every reason to brag, considering his contribution to, and his stature within, the web community. But he doesn't do that. Instead, he gives back over and over and over selflessly.

## Dan Is Hard-Working
I had the privilege to offer Dan a job a couple years ago, and he continues to be one of the hardest workers in the company. He never complains, always goes above and beyond, and is a joy to work next to.

So Dan, I raise my glass to you (yes, Iâ€™m holding a drink right now, why do you ask?). Thanks for all you've done for me personally, and for our community at large. You deserve every honor that comes your way.
