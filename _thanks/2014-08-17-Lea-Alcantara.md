Dan is a class act from beginning to end — he treated all Front-End Design Conf speakers with a ton of respect and kindness. When United Airlines lost my luggage, Dan and co-organizer Cherrie were tireless in hounding the airport to correct what had happened. They even paid for and provided me with emergency essentials due to the luggage snafu. Beyond that, they were extraordinarily attentive to both speaker and attendee alike. They kept the event warm and friendly, and when I spoke, Front-End Conf had a majority female lineup but it was publicized like any regular conference—a testament that they were committed to quality speakers first and foremost. I think the participants in Front-End Design Conf understand this, and it's with bittersweetness that I say good-bye to this great conference. Thank you Dan, Cherrie and the rest of the team that made Front-End Design Conf possible.
