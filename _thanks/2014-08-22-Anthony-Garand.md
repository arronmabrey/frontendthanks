Front-End Design Conference has been the most insightful, entertaining, and informative conference I have had the privilege of attending over the past 4 years.

Let me tell you a story,

In 2011 when I sent Dan (whom I didn't know at the time) a message saying that I would be unable to attend due to financial difficulties, he reached out to some friends and found me a room to stay in for the conference which made it possible for me to come down, to what would turn end up becoming a life changing event.

It was there that I met my future co-worker and boss, Brad Miller. Without Dan's help I don't know that I would be in the position I am currently. Thank you Dan, you've changed my life.

Last  year when I had difficulties with the hotel, Cherrie stepped in and helped sort it all out. The work that these two have gone through to create this extraordinary opportunity for designers and developers from all levels is amazing. Every year at the conference when Dan asks how many people are returning, there are a large number of hands, but what is equally incredible is that there are so many new people. People just beginning in the industry looking for people to learn from.

Thank you Dan. Thank you for everything you have done for me. Thank you for everything you have done for our industry.
