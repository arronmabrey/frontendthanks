I was fortunate enough to be asked to speak at the first Front End Conference many years ago. I’m pretty sure it was the first web related conference I ever went to, and I’ll never forget it. I made so many great friends that weekend - amazing people that I might have never met in person otherwise. Dan not only gave me my first chance to be a conference speaker, but got me involved in the web community in a way I hadn’t before. And for that I’m forever grateful. Thanks Dan and Cherrie! You guys rock!
