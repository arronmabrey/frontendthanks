Dan and Cherrie are two of the most generous, caring people I know of in our industry. There's no doubt in my mind they poured every ounce of love they possibly could into every Front End Design Conference. I'll always remember the address I gave in 2013, not because it was my best but because it was so warmly received by the audience. Clearly that's a reflection of the caliber of people they attract, and I'm honored to be one of those.
