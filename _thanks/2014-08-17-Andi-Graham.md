For six years, I've looked forward to spending a few rainy summer days immersed in the nerdy, creative community that is the Front End Design Conference. To immersing myself in my craft; to socializing with my idols; to discovering new approaches; affirming my decisions and to partying with all of your bad selves. And best of all - it was always just around the corner. A cab ride away after the after-party, if you will...

I'm gonna miss that.

The thought and care you put into selecting speakers; the selflessness of your passion; the foresight into trends and up-and-comers; and most importantly, the incredibly personal way you make everyone think that you wanted them there above all elseâ€¦

I'm gonna miss that.

Karaoke after-after parties, negotiating for drink tickets with non-drinkers, photo booth bombing, bacon everything of course, engaging conversations with my peers and colleagues, team-time with my staff, the glue of the Tampa Bay web community, the rain (OHSOMUCHRAIN) ...

I'm gonna miss that.

Dan and Cherrie: thank you for being amazing organizers, kind and thoughtful people, and great friends. I just hope our annual reason to see each other doesn't mean we never see each other again.
