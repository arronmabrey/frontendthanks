I was lucky enough to speak at Front End a few years back, and was immediately struck by how warm everything was. Okay, no: not the weather. (Though hey, St. Petersburg was looking rather stunning.) Really, the warmth was coming from everything else: the speakers were brilliant and passionate; the theater was breathtaking; and the attendees were smiling, thoughtful, and, well, nice.

And a large part of that warmth was due to Dan's hard work. He and Cherrie managed to bring some of the nicest people I'd ever met into one space, packed it full of informative, insightful talks, and infused it with their love of the web. Front End was one of my favorite events I've spoken atâ€”and while I'm sad I won't get a chance to go back, I'm so excited to see what Dan and Cherrie do next.

Dan, Cherrie: thank you.
