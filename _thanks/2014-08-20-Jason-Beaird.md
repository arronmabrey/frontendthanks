You know, I really only wanted to attend the conference and somehow I managed to get myself on stage this year in St. Pete. As I said before my talk, I had known about Front-End since the very beginning and my only regret (aside from that whole being on stage thing) is that I didn't make it to one before 2014. The event was everything I expected from what I had heard about previous years and a whole lot more. I've been to a lot of conferences and the camaraderie, humility and passion of everyone present made it unlike any other. I know first-hand that this kind of community doesn't just happen overnight. Dan, Cherrie and the rest of the Front-End Design Conference team have undoubtedly cultivated something magical and regardless of whether the conference goes on, the world (& the web) is a better place because of it. I'm thankful that I finally had the opportunity to be a part of the fun, supportive, amazing - and now, legendary - #frontendconf family.
