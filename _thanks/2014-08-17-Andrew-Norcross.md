I had attended the St. Petersburg conference a few times, and gotten to know Dan and Cherrie personally. I'm honored that I can call them my friends.

This year, I was given the opportunity to speak at the final St. Petersburg conference. Having attended in the past, I knew the caliber of speakers that Dan gets each year, so it was humbling (to say the least) to be included with such company. The event has been top-notch every time, with the little perks (chocolate bacon, anyone?) that easily made it my favorite conference to attend each year.
