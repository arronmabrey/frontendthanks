It's not everyday that you get to eat chocolate covered bacon but when the Front End Design Conference rolled around you were guaranteed that experience. Dan and Cherrie were always so kind to me and I'm so thankful that I was able to become friends with them. They always did an amazing job putting on the conference and it quickly became one of my favorite conferences to attend. It wasn't just about the knowledge being shared, it was the people.

Not only did I meet some amazing people, I met some future employees. I met Anthony Garand who later became one of my Front End Designers and Angela Crist who is now our Digital Strategist and Customer Advocate. You have helped our business by putting great people together and I'm grateful.

In 2012 we had a company hack week in St. Petersburg. The entire team came down for the conference. This was the year of the "Colors, Fonts and Shapes" presentation and we had a blast! We rented a house and worked on a product idea that is launching this year. We also had you both over for a BBQ that included Jason Vanlue and Matthew Graham (I think there is a photo somewhere....) and that was a lot of fun. I could say 2012 was my favorite year but I prefer saying I really had an awesome time between the years of 2011-2014.

Dan and Cherrie you are not just conference organizers, you are an inspiration, kind, thoughtful, funny, amazing people. But most of all you are my friends. St. Petersburg, FL will always be something special to me because of you. Thank you so much. Now where is the hug emoticon.....
