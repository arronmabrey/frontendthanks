Front End Design Conference was one of my most favoritest conferences I've ever spoken at! The talks, the attendees, the venue, it was all amazing. Also the opportunity to give more people the chance to share their knowledge with attendee-submitted talks cultivates an incredibly special community and experience. I know why this happens. Because of the amazing team that puts on this inclusive, welcoming, super unique conference. Cherrie and Dan are two of the raddest, most talented folks I know. Thanks for putting your hearts into a great conference and giving us all an opportunity to learn from each other and do the running man together.
