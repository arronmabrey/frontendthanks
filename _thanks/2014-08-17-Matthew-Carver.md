I haven't known Dan Denney for very long. I met Dan just in time to get to see Front End Design Conference before it ended, but I'm incredibly fortunate for getting the opportunity. Dan's optimism, graciousness, and earnestness created the warmest community of people I've ever met in the people who attended his conferences. The world is full of cynics, because it's easy to be cynical. Being a positive person is tough, but creating positivity in others is damn near a miracle. Even though I only this year got to attend Front End Design Conference, I immediately recognized it as something incredibly special and it was only possible thanks to an incredible dude.
