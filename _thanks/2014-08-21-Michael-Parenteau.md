Dan & Cherrie,

The two of you are some of the most humble, kind and welcoming people I have ever met. I had the honor of attending 3 Front-end confs, spoke at one.. and every time I see y’all it just warms my heart. From first meeting Dan at Lessconf and stumbling down the streets in Atlanta several years back. to picking you up at the airport in PDX for your planning this last Frontendconf… man, you are super awesome. You are amazing at what you do… not only are you a fan of the community.. but you are an important member of the community. I wish you and your family all the best on your next travels and adventures! Thanks for all you’ve done!

Michael
