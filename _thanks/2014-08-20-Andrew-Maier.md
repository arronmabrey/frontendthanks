Dear Dan,

Thanks so much for taking a chance on me as a speaker for your inaugural Front End Design conference. That experience was honestly the first time I'd ever spoken in front of so many people at a professional design event. It really gave me the shock I needed to begin taking speaking seriously and double down on my commitment to user experience design. People like you do so much for our community, so much for the fledgling designers that really want to make a difference in the world and just need a chance to be heard. Keep kicking ass and changing lives.

Your friend,
Andrew Maier
