Front-end Conference was the origin of the mustache and one of the first conferences I had spoken at. Dan took a chance and gave me the opportunity to speak among some of my own personal web heroes. Dan and Cherrie were kind and welcoming and helped create a very inviting and inclusive culture with the attendees and speakers. They set the bar pretty high on what I expected other conferences to be like.
