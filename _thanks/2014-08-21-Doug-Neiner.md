Dan and Cherrie - Front End Design Conference has meant so much to me over the years. Not just because the conference is amazing, but because you and Cherrie are amazing. You put your heart into these conferences and it showed in everything from the striking venues to the incredible food. I never would have understood the magic that is chocolate covered bacon had it not been for FEDC! The experience of both speaking and attending is one I will not soon forget. Thank you for all you have done for me personally and for the community these past years!
