# frontendthanks.com

The concept is young. My goal is to create a page for thanking Dan and Cherrie for all they have done with frontend. I would like to get the site live sometime by the end of this week so we have time before frontend to get the last few stragglers to Portland. Please help. 

The site is a jekyll site and will live on github pages. I welcome contributions to the site, lets just keep in communication and use GitHub Issues to converse about features etc. Eventually individuals will submit pull requests to add their 'thanks' message to the site. 

### Development

```
script/boostrap
```
Will setup the local enviornment. This assumes you have Ruby and homebrew installed.

```
script/server
```
Will get the localserver up and running AND watch the SCSS files with Compass. Please don't make modifications to the CSS directly, all edits should happen in the SCSS files and will compile from there. 

As your adding features please use branches and submit pull requests back into master. This will keep us all on the same page and direction. Also, **do not** push to gh-pages as of yet. Remember all gh-pages branches are public and this will release it to the world. 


### Wireframe

I'll create issues with the individual pages and welcome those who have access to collaborate on the feature set, design, etc.

If you have any issues let me know, once we get the base of the site done we'll opensource it and allow others to fork and add content.
