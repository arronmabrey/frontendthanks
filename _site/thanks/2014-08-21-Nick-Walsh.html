  <p>Not long after the fourth iteration of Front-End, I asked Dan what compelled him to start his own event. Sheepishly, he just smiled and said it was an amazing excuse to talk with industry folks in St. Pete - both talented attendees and devoted speakers. He worked to make the conference something he would love going to, and that was infectious.</p>

<p>It&#39;s always been easy discern what sort of person Dan is. Year after year, the event staff is made up of his family: Cherrie, his mom, his daughter, brothers-in-law, and countless others. They don&#39;t just go through the motions - they&#39;ve become part of Front-End. When Jason (who&#39;d go on to speak twice) and I first attended, they supplied gluten-free snacks and libations unprompted so that he could partake as well. Those sort of things stick with you.</p>

<p>As a company, we try to attend at least one local (Florida) conference and something outside the state each year. Even with the ability to pick events virtually anywhere, the little get-together in St. Pete was always the team&#39;s favorite.</p>

<p>Dan, it was a  pleasure to attend and later take part in Front-End. I&#39;m sad to see it go, but having you on the team is no small consolation. Thank you.</p>
