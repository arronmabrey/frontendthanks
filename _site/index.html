        <p><p>I&#39;ve traveled around the globe to different conferences (Lion France, Racife Brazil, Honolulu, etc). and I have seen some amazing geographical locations to host the most incredible events in our industry; but I&#39;ve never had a team of people welcome me into anyone of those events like Dan and Cherrie have. Anyone who has ever attended Front-End conf in St. Petersburg, Florida knows this kind of welcoming. My quick three thoughts:</p>

<h2>Industry Friends</h2>

<p>Dan and I had met previously in St. Petersburg while I was vacationing and after a few drinks and pizza I knew I didn&#39;t want to miss the event. It was like a bromance in its early stages. Since, so many of the friendships I&#39;ve made via frontend have proven to be the most &#39;twittered&#39; relationships that I have. Across the globe and country Front-End started that.</p>

<h2>On Stage</h2>

<p>Dan asked me to speak in 2012, however, I was way to nervous for that. Instead I talked GitHub into sponsoring the party and enjoyed my first Front-End event as a spectator. In 2013 he asked me back; and I couldn&#39;t say no. My first full length stage debut, <a href="http://madebygraham.com/2013/Speaking-Out/">Front-End 2013</a>. A memory I&#39;ll have forever.</p>

<h2>Final Thank You</h2>

<p>Dan and Cherrie have birthed (sorry for that visual) an event like no other. From chocolate covered bacon to late night karaoke we&#39;ll all miss the event itself, but thankfully due to the hard work they&#39;ve put in, we&#39;re now able to build on these memories forever. Thank you guys.</p>

        <p><p>A butterfly flaps its wings in St. Petersburg, fours years later a guy gets to quit his day job to pursue his own passions. Sometimes it&#39;s hard to pinpoint what events in your life lead you to where you are now, but in my case, one of them is very easy: Front End Design Conference.</p>

<p>Dan invited me to the very first one (remember when Dan was @webdesignfanboy on Twitter?!). Shaking in my boots, I accepted. I had never spoken at a conference before. I went, I did it. I refuse to watch the recording - I&#39;m sure it was god-awful - but it doesn&#39;t matter. It gave me confidence, it gave me motivation, and it opened up doors for me.</p>

<p>Thank you, Dan, Cherrie, and the whole Front End Design Conference gang for changing my life, and countless others, for the better.</p>

        <p><p>For six years, I&#39;ve looked forward to spending a few rainy summer days immersed in the nerdy, creative community that is the Front End Design Conference. To immersing myself in my craft; to socializing with my idols; to discovering new approaches; affirming my decisions and to partying with all of your bad selves. And best of all - it was always just around the corner. A cab ride away after the after-party, if you will...</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna miss that.</p>

<p>The thought and care you put into selecting speakers; the selflessness of your passion; the foresight into trends and up-and-comers; and most importantly, the incredibly personal way you make everyone think that you wanted them there above all elseâ€¦</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna miss that.</p>

<p>Karaoke after-after parties, negotiating for drink tickets with non-drinkers, photo booth bombing, bacon everything of course, engaging conversations with my peers and colleagues, team-time with my staff, the glue of the Tampa Bay web community, the rain (OHSOMUCHRAIN) ...</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna miss that.</p>

<p>Dan and Cherrie: thank you for being amazing organizers, kind and thoughtful people, and great friends. I just hope our annual reason to see each other doesn&#39;t mean we never see each other again.</p>

        <p><p>I had attended the St. Petersburg conference a few times, and gotten to know Dan and Cherry personally. I&#39;m honored that I can call them my friends.</p>

<p>This year, I was given the opportunity to speak at the final St. Petersburg conference. Having attended in the past, I knew the caliber of speakers that Dan gets each year, so it was humbling (to say the least) to be included with such company. The event has been top-notch every time, with the little perks (chocolate bacon, anyone?) that easily made it my favorite conference to attend each year.</p>

        <p><p>Dan and Cherrie are two of the most generous, caring people I know of in our industry. There&#39;s no doubt in my mind they poured every ounce of love they possibly could into every Front End Design Conference. I&#39;ll always remember the address I gave in 2013, not because it was my best but because it was so warmly received by the audience. Clearly that&#39;s a reflection of the caliber of people they attract, and I&#39;m honored to be one of those.</p>

        <p><p>I was lucky enough to speak at Front End a few years back, and was immediately struck by how warm everything was. Okay, no: not the weather. (Though hey, St. Petersburg was looking rather stunning.) Really, the warmth was coming from everything else: the speakers were brilliant and passionate; the theater was breathtaking; and the attendees were smiling, thoughtful, and, well, nice.</p>

<p>And a large part of that warmth was due to Dan&#39;s hard work. He and Cherrie managed to bring some of the nicest people I&#39;d ever met into one space, packed it full of informative, insightful talks, and infused it with their love of the web. Front End was one of my favorite events I&#39;ve spoken atâ€”and while I&#39;m sad I won&#39;t get a chance to go back, I&#39;m so excited to see what Dan and Cherrie do next.</p>

<p>Dan, Cherrie: thank you.</p>

        <p><p>Dan Denney, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways:</p>

<h3>Dan Is Generous</h3>

<p>Seriously, Dan is one of the most genuine, kind, and generous people I&#39;ve come to know. He always thinks of others first, and himself last.</p>

<h3>Dan Is Humble</h3>

<p>He has every reason to brag, considering his contribution to, and his stature within, the web community. But he doesn&#39;t do that. Instead, he gives back over and over and over selflessly.</p>

<h3>Dan Is Hard-Working</h3>

<p>I had the privilege to offer Dan a job a couple years ago, and he continues to be one of the hardest workers in the company. He never complains, always goes above and beyond, and is a joy to work next to.</p>

<p>So Dan, I raise my glass to you (yes, I&#39;m holding a drink right now, why do you ask?). Thanks for all you&#39;ve done for me personally, and for our community at large. You deserve every honor that comes your way.</p>

        <p><p>Front End Design Conference was one of my most favoritest conferences I&#39;ve ever spoken at! The talks, the attendees, the venue, it was all amazing. Also the opportunity to give more people the chance to share their knowledge with attendee-submitted talks cultivates an incredibly special community and experience. I know why this happens. Because of the amazing team that puts on this inclusive, welcoming, super unique conference. Cherrie and Dan are two of the raddest, most talented folks I know. Thanks for putting your hearts into a great conference and giving us all an opportunity to learn from each other and do the running man together.</p>

        <p><p>Dan is a class act from beginning to end â€” he treated all Front-End Design Conf speakers with a ton of respect and kindness. When United Airlines lost my luggage, Dan and co-organizer Cherrie were tireless in hounding the airport to correct what had happened. They even paid for and provided me with emergency essentials due to the luggage snafu. Beyond that, they were extraordinarily attentive to both speaker and attendee alike. They kept the event warm and friendly, and when I spoke, Front-End Conf had a majority female lineup but it was publicized like any regular conferenceâ€”a testament that they were committed to quality speakers first and foremost. I think the participants in Front-End Design Conf understand this, and it&#39;s with bittersweetness that I say good-bye to this great conference. Thank you Dan, Cherrie and the rest of the team that made Front-End Design Conf possible.</p>

        <p><p>I haven&#39;t known Dan Denney for very long. I met Dan just in time to get to see Front End Design Conference before it ended, but I&#39;m incredibly fortunate for getting the opportunity. Dan&#39;s optimism, graciousness, and earnestness created the warmest community of people I&#39;ve ever met in the people who attended his conferences. The world is full of cynics, because it&#39;s easy to be cynical. Being a positive person is tough, but creating positivity in others is damn near a miracle. Even though I only this year got to attend Front End Design Conference, I immediately recognized it as something incredibly special and it was only possible thanks to an incredible dude.</p>

        <p><p>Who would&#39;ve thought Hip-hop and the Web would be a great topic at Front End Design Conference? Turns out I was lucky that Dan did. In most cases he turned out be a bigger Hip-hop enthusiast than me. More than I think he knows, Dan has been a great role model to me on and offline. Dan gave me a chance to speak on something I was passionate about for the first time in front my peers and for that I&#39;ll forever be grateful.. Front End Design Conference on the whole has made me a better person in multiple aspects of my profession. I can&#39;t imagine where I&#39;d be today without it.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that we&#39;re going to keep the spirit of the conference alive in one way or another (The Bahamas is still on the table haha).</p>

<p>I wish Dan, Cherrie and the entire family all the best. To many more years of moving the web forward!</p>

        <p><p>Dear Dan,</p>

<p>Thanks so much for taking a chance on me as a speaker for your inaugural Front End Design conference. That experience was honestly the first time I&#39;d ever spoken in front of so many people at a professional design event. It really gave me the shock I needed to begin taking speaking seriously and double down on my commitment to user experience design. People like you do so much for our community, so much for the fledgling designers that really want to make a difference in the world and just need a chance to be heard. Keep kicking ass and changing lives.</p>

<p>Your friend,

        <p><p>I (not so) vividly remember trying to buy a round of drinks for Dan at one of the Front-End Conf after-parties. If you&rsquo;ve every tried to buy Dan a drink, you know how difficult it can be. He&rsquo;s the kind of guy that wants to <em>buy</em> the drink, not have one bought for him. Somehow, I managed to sneak one in&#8212;a PBR in a can&#8212;and was then carted to the karaoke stage along with Dan and a few other attendees where we promptly sang Bon Jovi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Livin&rsquo; on a Prayer.&rdquo; Just one of many great memories I have from Front-End Design Conference. Good times. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only known Dan for a couple years, but I knew after first speaking with him that he was a kindred spirit. He demonstrates the kinds of qualities I&rsquo;m really drawn to in this biz: humility, skill, and empathy for his team. Nowhere has this been more evident than in he and Cherrie&rsquo;s organizing of the Front-End Design Conference. They&rsquo;ve done a fantastic job of curating incredibly relevant content but also facilitating great interactions.</p>

<p>Dan, Cherrie, and their family have given a lot over the years. They&rsquo;ve provided an amzaing place to exchange ideas. They&rsquo;ve brought us together. I&rsquo;m grateful for it and truly believe our industry is better because of them. Thanks Dan and Cherrie. You guys rock.</p>

        <p><p>You know, I really only wanted to attend the conference and somehow I managed to get myself on stage this year in St. Pete. As I said before my talk, I had known about Front-End since the very beginning and my only regret (aside from that whole being on stage thing) is that I didn&#39;t make it to one before 2014. The event was everything I expected from what I had heard about previous years and a whole lot more. I&#39;ve been to a lot of conferences and the camaraderie, humility and passion of everyone present made it unlike any other. I know first-hand that this kind of community doesn&#39;t just happen overnight. Dan, Cherrie and the rest of the Front-End Design Conference team have undoubtedly cultivated something magical and regardless of whether the conference goes on, the world (&amp; the web) is a better place because of it. I&#39;m thankful that I finally had the opportunity to be a part of the fun, supportive, amazing - and now, legendary - #frontendconf family.</p>

        <p><p>Front-end Conference was the origin of the mustache and one of the first conferences I had spoken at. Dan took a chance and gave me the opportunity to speak among some of my own personal web heroes. Dan and Cherrie were kind and welcoming and helped create a very inviting and inclusive culture with the attendees and speakers. They set the bar pretty high on what I expected other conferences to be like.</p>

You put your heart into these conferences and it showed in everything from the striking venues to the incredible food. I never would have understood the magic that is chocolate covered bacon had it not been for FEDC! The experience of both speaking and attending is one I will not soon forget. Thank you for all you have done for me personally and for the community these past years!</p>

        <p><p>I was fortunate enough to be asked to speak at the first Front End Conference many years ago. I&#39;m pretty sure it was the first web related conference I ever went to, and I&#39;ll never forget it. I made so many great friends that weekend - amazing people that I might have never met in person otherwise. Dan not only gave me my first chance to be a conference speaker, but got me involved in the web community in a way I hadn&#39;t before. And for that I&#39;m forever grateful. Thanks Dan and Cherrie! You guys rock!</p>

        <p><p>Dan &amp; Cherrie,</p>

<p>The two of you are some of the most humble, kind and welcoming people I have ever met. I had the honor of attending 3 Front-end confs, spoke at one.. and every time I see y&#39;all it just warms my heart. From first meeting Dan at Lessconf and stumbling down the streets in Atlanta several years back. to picking you up at the airport in PDX for your planning this last Frontendconfâ€¦ man, you are super awesome. You are amazing at what you doâ€¦ not only are you a fan of the community.. but you are an important member of the community. I wish you and your family all the best on your next travels and adventures! Thanks for all you&#39;ve done!</p>

<p>Michael</p>

        <p><p>Not long after the fourth iteration of Front-End, I asked Dan what compelled him to start his own event. Sheepishly, he just smiled and said it was an amazing excuse to talk with industry folks in St. Pete - both talented attendees and devoted speakers. He worked to make the conference something he would love going to, and that was infectious.</p>

<p>It&#39;s always been easy discern what sort of person Dan is. Year after year, the event staff is made up of his family: Cherrie, his mom, his daughter, brothers-in-law, and countless others. They don&#39;t just go through the motions - they&#39;ve become part of Front-End. When Jason (who&#39;d go on to speak twice) and I first attended, they supplied gluten-free snacks and libations unprompted so that he could partake as well. Those sort of things stick with you.</p>

<p>As a company, we try to attend at least one local (Florida) conference and something outside the state each year. Even with the ability to pick events virtually anywhere, the little get-together in St. Pete was always the team&#39;s favorite.</p>

<p>Dan, it was a  pleasure to attend and later take part in Front-End. I&#39;m sad to see it go, but having you on the team is no small consolation. Thank you.</p>
